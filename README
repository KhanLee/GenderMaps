This map uses the DynamicMapsEngineLayer, drawing from a styled Layer in Google
Maps Engine.  It also pulls attribute data from the datasource of the layer
using the GME API, and it combines these with additional attribute data that
was exported from a BigQuery analysis summarizing the count of males and females
aggregated by their birth location and a set of the most popular professions
listed in Freebase.
